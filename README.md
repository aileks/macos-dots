# Addicted to Configuration

### My dotfiles repo for both macOS and Linux

Main has macOS dots for Zsh, Yabai, WezTerm, Sketchybar, Skhd, Tmux, Zed, and Neovim. <br />

NOTE: I no longer use yabai nor sketchybar, and the setup.sh script won't symlink their configs. They are kept here for reference and as a back-up.

Checkout the [linux](https://github.com/aileks/dotfiles/tree/linux) branch for i3wm.
